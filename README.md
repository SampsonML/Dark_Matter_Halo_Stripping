# Dark_Matter_Halo_Stripping

A set of 3 python fuctions that adaptively calculate the mean radius,particle velocity and rate of tidal stripping in N-body dark matter halo simulations.

The mass fraction of the halo to be tracked is defined with the input parameters.

Works with hdf5 file formats, with Gadget-style headers.
